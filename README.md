## Express Routes

### General information

To tell our server how to deal with any given request, we registered two routes. Routes define the control flow for requests based on the requestâ€™s path and HTTP verb.
For example, if your server receives a GET request, we use a route to define the appropriate functionality for that HTTP verb (GET) and path (/).
Express uses app.get() to register routes to match GET requests. Express routes (including app.get()) usually take two arguments, a path (usually a string), and a callback function to handle the request and send a response.
Express servers send responses using the .send() method on the response object. .send() will take any input and include it in the response body.
